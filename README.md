Object detection is a groundbreaking computer vision task that has a ton of applications across various industries. It goes beyond traditional image classification, where a model assigns a single label to an entire image, to identify and locate multiple objects within an image, often accompanied by bounding boxes outlining their positions.

When working on custom models for object detection or other machine learning tasks, one of the challenges that researchers and developers may encounter is the lack of suitable databases or datasets. Overcoming these challenges often requires creativity and resourcefulness so this post will focus on how to create your custom database.


Build a YOLO11l object detection model on a custom dataset and the corresponding application using Streamlit. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient implementation of real-time object detection that can be easily customized and integrated into other applications.
